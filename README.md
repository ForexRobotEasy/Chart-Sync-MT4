Please note that ForexRobotEasy is not the official developer of this product. We are showcasing a sample code that can work as described in this product. To find the official developer of this product, please use MQL5.

**How It Works:**

The Chart Sync MT4 indicator is developed in MQL5 and is designed to work with MetaTrader 5 trading terminals. The indicator utilizes global variables to store information related to symbol synchronization, chart synchronization, and selected timeframes. 

Upon initialization, the global variables are initialized and the indicator is ready for use. The `OnInit()` function is responsible for this initialization process. Additional initialization code can be added to this function as needed.

The `OnDeinit()` function is used for deinitialization and can be used to clean up any resources or perform any necessary actions before the indicator is removed from the chart.

The `OnCalculate()` function is the main calculation function of the indicator. It receives the necessary price data and other information for the indicator's calculations. The indicator's calculation code can be added to this function to perform the desired analysis or calculations.

Please note that the provided code is a skeleton and does not contain the actual calculation logic. Traders can customize and add their own calculations based on their specific requirements.

**Code Structure:**

1. Global Variables: 
   - `g_SyncedSymbol`: Symbol selected by the trader for synchronization.
   - `g_SyncAllCharts`: Flag to indicate if all charts should be synchronized.
   - `g_SyncedTimeframe`: Timeframe selected by the trader for synchronization.

2. Custom Indicator Initialization Function (`OnInit()`): 
   - Initializes global variables.
   - Additional initialization code can be added here.

3. Custom Indicator Deinitialization Function (`OnDeinit()`): 
   - Performs deinitialization tasks.
   - Additional deinitialization code can be added here.

4. Custom Indicator Calculation Function (`OnCalculate()`): 
   - Receives price data and other information for calculations.
   - Placeholder for adding custom calculation code.

**Important Note:**

Please be aware that the provided code is a general framework and does not include the actual calculation logic. Traders are advised to modify the code and add their own calculations based on their specific requirements.
